# Hobbyprojects

Currently working with React.js. Working on styled components, establishing different styling methadologies and API's for content fetch. The next step will be Node.js with Express.js, where I will explore email functionality, login functionality, server hosting with React.js as frontend, and handling of e.g GET/POST requests. Eventually I will also begin exploring C++ and maybe even C#.
